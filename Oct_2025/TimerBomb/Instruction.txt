🎯 Project: Time Bomb in UE5
📁 Location

Content → Items → BombC4

We will create a Blueprint class (BP_Bomb) to control the bomb functionality.


🧱 Step 1: Create the Bomb Blueprint

Right-click in Content Browser → Blueprint Class → Actor

Name it BP_Bomb

Open BP_Bomb


🧩 Step 2: Add Components

Add a Static Mesh component → assign the BombC4 mesh

Adjust size and position as needed

(Optional) Add a Sphere component → scale it to (0.01, 0.01, 0.01) (for light effect later)


⚙️ Step 3: Add Explosion Logic (Event Graph)

Go to Event Graph

Add nodes in sequence:

Event BeginPlay

PlaySound2D (for bomb activation sound)

Delay (10 seconds)

PlaySound2D (for explosion sound)

Spawn Emitter at Location

Use Get Actor Location for the emitter location

Choose an explosion template (e.g., P_Explosion or similar)

Adjust Scale of explosion if needed

Destroy Actor (to remove bomb after explosion)

✅ Result: The bomb explodes automatically after 10 seconds.


💡 Step 4: Add Flashing Light Effect

Add a Sphere Component (acts as emissive light)

Create a new Material → name it M_RedLight

Press 3 + Left Click to create a Vector Parameter (for color)

Press 1 + Left Click to create a Constant (for intensity)

Connect nodes to Emissive Color

Apply M_RedLight to the Sphere


⏱ Step 5: Add Timer for Flashing Light

Use Set Timer by Event

Make the light flash (toggle visibility or change color every tick)

For the last 2 seconds before explosion:

Use Clear and Invalidate Timer by Handle

Change the light to flash faster or brighter for a more dramatic effect


✅ Final Behavior

Bomb plays an activation sound when placed.

After 10 seconds:

Explosion sound + particle effect.

Bomb is destroyed.

During countdown:

Red light flashes slowly, then rapidly before explosion.
