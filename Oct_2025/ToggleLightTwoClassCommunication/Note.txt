Short Note – Communication Between BP_Test and PointLight

Create a PointLight in the level.

In BP_Test (first class just with a cube inside), add a variable named PointLight → type: PointLight (Object Reference) → make it Instance Editable and Expose on Spawn.

In BP_Test, use this variable to toggle light visibility (e.g., Toggle Visibility or Set Visibility).

In general:

When Class A needs to affect Class B, create a variable in A of type B (Object Reference).

Assign the reference in the Level/PIE.

Trigger the desired event (e.g., on Hit, call function on B).

If it doesn’t work, add a small Delay (1s) before triggering.
