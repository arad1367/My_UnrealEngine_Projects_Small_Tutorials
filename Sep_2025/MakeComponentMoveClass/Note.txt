When you Add Actor, you’re creating a new Actor in the level. Any meshes inside that Actor’s hierarchy move together as one, because the Actor is the parent.

When you Add Component (inside an existing Actor), each mesh is its own component. You can transform or move each component independently without affecting the other meshes in the Actor.
