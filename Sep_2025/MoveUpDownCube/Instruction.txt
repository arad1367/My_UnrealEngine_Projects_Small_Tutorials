UE5 Tutorial: Make any mesh float up/down in a loop and rotate

1) Create the Actor
File → New C++/Blueprint Class → Actor → name it BP_FloatingActor.
Open it and add a Static Mesh component.
Assign any mesh (Cube, Sphere, your own). This will be the moving piece.

2) Add rotation (always spinning)
In the Components panel, Add → Rotating Movement.
In Details → Rotation Rate, set Z = 50.0 (X=0, Y=0). The actor will spin around Z.

3) Create the Timeline
In the Components or My Blueprint panel, Add → Timeline. Name it FloatingObject.
Double‑click the Timeline to open it.
Click “+ Track” → Vector Track → name it NewTrack_0.
We only need Z:
Add key at Time = 0.0, Z = 0.0 (X=0, Y=0, Z=0).
Add key at Time = 5.0, Z = 10.0 (X=0, Y=0, Z=10).
Set Length = 5.0 seconds.
Optional loop styles:
To ping‑pong (up then down then up…): enable Use Last Keyframe? off, and in Blueprint we’ll connect Play/Reverse on Finished. Or
To simple loop: tick Loop (it will reset to Z=0 after reaching Z=10).
Close the Timeline tab.

4) Blueprint wiring (Event Graph)
Event BeginPlay → drag the FloatingObject Timeline into the graph → call Play.
From the FloatingObject node’s Update pin:
Drag from the NewTrack_0 output (Vector) into “Set Relative Location.”
Target = your Static Mesh component.
Leave Sweep/Teleport defaults.
For ping‑pong motion:
From Finished pin → call Reverse.
From Reverse’s Finished → call Play. (This makes it go up, then down, forever.)
For simple looping instead of ping‑pong:
Just check Loop on the Timeline and don’t wire Reverse.

5) Test
Place BP_FloatingActor in your level.
Press Play: the mesh should rise from Z=0 to Z=10 over 5 seconds, then return (ping‑pong) or restart (loop), while continuously rotating at 50 deg/sec.

6) Customize
Change Z key values to control height (e.g., 0 → 75).
Change Timeline Length to control speed.
Edit Rotation Rate (Rotating Movement) for faster/slower spin or rotate on other axes.
Swap the Static Mesh to use any other mesh without changing the logic.
